1163,2023-11-09,"It was a possible TBI – it was cold for the first time that winter so I was wearing a neck gaiter, my glasses fogged up, AND I was rushing to get to a dental cleaning appointment (didn’t want to get a strike; 3 strikes and you are denied any dental treatments for 1-1/2 years! I wasn’t sure if I already had one) … so pushed on, without wiping the fog off my glasses, so effectively blindly –down the uneven, 3D brick sidewalk, which had a slope of about 45 degrees, tripped and did a face plant on the very unforgiving bricks. My facial bleeding and my lying facedown on the sidewalk drew the attention of some passersby, 1 of whom gave me a handkerchief for the bleeding and another called the ambulance. Thankfully one was stopped just around the corner from me. I have found that arriving by ambulance gets the most rapid medical attention … I also describe this as a “possible TBI” because I answered all of the “brain injury screening” questions correctly and nothing was remarkable about my CT scan; neither of which, sadly, rules out a possible mild brain injury.
I describe these events, which unfortunately, though not as dramatically, have been occurring more often of late, as my “sidewalk diving practice”. Humor, especially a self deprecating ironic attitude has been key in my recovery. 
Another reason I believe that it was another TBI is because I had vestibular issues afterwards, for which I had specialized PT. This treatment resolved those issues. I am still reluctant to walk anywhere outside.

My late wife performed CPR and revived me, in a little 6 minutes. 
I was on my way to the hospital and went into come, on the way. At this point, the doctors told my wife that I was very seriously injury. They let her know that they were doing all they could do, but sadly to sat, he may not survive. 
I was in a coma for nine days. At this time, I have know idea that anything happened, for that day through about 2 weeks at rehabilitation. I was at the hospital for 1 month and went to an in town rehabilitation. I was at rehabilitation for 2 months. 
At rehabilitation, was given Pt, OT, SpT, and was given a psychologist. I was given therapy twice a day. They therapist swapped each day. They have told me that I was doing better day for day. 
I was released to go home. At this point, I went to the same therapists, for twice a day, for 21/2 years. I need to tell you that rehabilitation was incredible. With what they from the time I started in-house, to they therapy, for better than 21/2 years. Also, I am still seeing the same psychologist. 
After 2 months,I came home. There were times that were real hard. For 2 years I fought the desire, to commit suicide. Thankfully, I didn’t. The time after that and continues therapy, counseling, and the total love of my life, I have continued on with my life. 
Prior to the accident, I really had a pretty bed attitude. I had been able to hide this, but through time over Andover I was pretty unhappy. 
Since the early time, with the help and love I was given, I ended with and still have discovered a wonderful life. 
I have joined a Support group,  given even more help , through committee work and visiting many conferences, 4 years late, I was asked, to become a member, of a presentation group.  I also was asked by rehabilitation, to become a peer mentor. I became a member of the state BIAA- ME and BIAA-America. Four years ago I was ask to be a member of ABIAC.. This is a committee that meets and study what the state is doing for the Brain Injury and possible treatment, for the Committee to bring up possible help for BI patients. 
This was my story, 15 years ago. This pandemic has made it tough, but we have continued on remotely.

I left with my bike on the CalTrain in San Mateo at around 6pm. Arrived in San Francisco around 6:45pm and then pedaled myself to one of my true passions in life…craft beer, 21st Amendment brewery and then went to City Beer Store for another craft beer. I pedaled away and realized I was headed in the wrong direction, stopped and asked a couple the way to Russian Hill, they told me and I started pedaling in the right direction. I then turned onto a main road and started going downhill. As I traveled downhill I didn’t notice the trolly track because they were foreign to me. My front bicycle tire then gets caught in the track and I flip over head first (had my helmet on thankfully). I stood up immediately and three bicyclist on the sidewalk saw it all go down and said I needed to go to the emergency room and then stopped a taxi van for me. He put my bike in the back, then asked me where I wanted to go, and I said CalTrain. I waited for around 15 minutes for the CalTrain, got me and my bike on, took a few pictures of my head because I knew something was wrong, but TBIs were so foreign to me I thought it was just a concussion, so I thought staying up throughout the night would do well enough.

I got on the lift again with the boys although i dont remember doing this. Halfway up with eyes closed I told the boys not to be alarmed, but I couldnt get them back down the mountain.

490,2020-07-18,"I was home in my apartment in Manhattan on a Saturday afternoon. I wanted to go for a run in the park but my wife advised me not to as it was about 95 degrees out and she feared it was too hot to run. I listened to her and changed my mind to do a quick 20-30 work out on a yoga mat, some push-ups, sit-ups, elastic bands. I had gotten into a bit of a routine during quarantine with a home workout. About 2 sets (maybe 10 mins in) I got a headache on the left side of my head. I came out of our bedroom into the living room and told my wife, sat down thinking maybe I had a migraine. I had never had one before. Then as time progressed things got a little more serious.. I vomited and then thought what I had was food poisening- and my massive headache was due to the heat. I had over worked myself and had a bad lunch. Then things got even more serious I could not sit up straight, I couldn't stand or walk. I thought I could just lay down and the feeling would pass. Eventually I would be able to drink the rest of my water my wife had given me.. I could take a shower and cool off. That never happened.. My wife thankfully reacted perfectly after seeing me not getting any better and called 911. Within 10 mins EMTs arrived, I was brought to Lenox Hill (thankfully living across the park in the Upper West Side) ER and catscanned/something. It was found that I had an AVM, and vesel of veins had burst and my headache was due to the swelling of my skull/pressure from the bleed. I had emergency brain surgery that night and spent 10 or so days in the ICU. Then about 1 week in in-patient rehab (thank god). And am now home \"working\" remotely for same job, they've been incredibly nice to me and my wife throughout this whole time. I've shifted roles, departments, and really realize that they do care about me. My wife cares about me. I just cannot get over whatever this is that I cannot describe.. This acceptance that though I am on my feet, working, living, typing this note right now, that I am not who I was before July 18th. And It's terrifying. I oddly enjoyed rehab and PT as I could strive for goals and reach them. Right now nothing is quantifiable when trying to fix my mindset. I cannot check goals off a list. Its a cycle of the unknown.

It was a beautiful day, and there was tree cutting ahead of me.   The man in a work van never stopped.   He hit me in the back.   At the last seconds, he turned away and the majority of the hit was to the left back then up the left side.   Thank god there was a small patch of grass with guardrail.   When he turned hard to the left, the van stopped on the grass on left side of road.   I sustained a concussion with fractured nose and severe injury to muscle and nervous system.   My concussion went undiagnosed for a year.    I tried to ignore the symptoms, and it almost destroyed me.   I was age 50 and at the best physical shape….  And began to put more energy into my career.  Life as I knew it stopped, and my struggle began for answers and recovery.   At that time, my children were in college.   My son and I are close, but he lives in Europe.   My daughter now has 3 children.   She took my accident and blamed me for all the turmoil it caused.   Our relationship is awful.    She uses my disability when it suits her.   Other than that, I have had no support from her or my mother.   They both believed I was making “to much of my accident).    The psychological impact was severe.    All my psychological pain became physical.   As an empath and light worker, which I did not realize at the time, my emotions took over completely; and my behavior juvenile.    It’s been a search for answers to my questions for 15 years.

1180,2023-11-01,"While traveling, I experienced an extreme headache, which was unusual for me, as I do not get headaches of any kind. After 5 days of travel, I went to my local ER at a major medical facility, where I received an MRI, a CT scan, and a CTA scan. Nothing significant was noted. The doctors diagnosed me with IIH (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension) and said that I would need a lumbar puncture to confirm diagnosis. I declined, opted for a medication management route, and was sent home. I returned to the ER the following day for worsening pressure in my head, episodes of \"blacking out\" and at that time was told to undergo a lumbar puncture. My ICP was very high, my LP read 35, and 30cc of spinal fluid was drained and sent to the lab for testing. I was put on 1 hour of bedrest following my LP and was then sent home. I woke up at approximately 1am the following morning with what I described as the worst headache of my life. I immediately went to the same ER where I underwent additional scans, all of which showed no new changes according to the radiology team. Because of the unresolved pain, and 3 days of ER returns, I was admitted under observation, where I was kept for 6 days without full admission to the hospital. The doctors were treating me for both low- and high-pressure headaches depending on how I was feeling at the moment of their visits to my room. I was finally discharged with the diagnosis of IIH. I sought a second opinion at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN because I still felt like the IIH diagnosis was incorrect or there was possibly a second, missed diagnosis. I was rescanned at Mayo and was found to have bilateral vertebral artery dissections, as well as a blood clot in my brain which was causing small TIAs due to micro emboli breaking off of the blood clot. At the time of this diagnosis (roughly 1.5 months following my initial IIH diagnosis), I was told to be outside of the therapeutic range for receiving IV anticoagulation. This would have been the ideal treatment method for the dissection diagnosis. I was started on Plavix for 6 months and was then sent to a myriad of doctors within the Mayo Clinic system, where I am still being followed one year later.

1193,2023-07-07,"I was rear ended by an off-duty Police Officer while slowing down for a large pot hole. I was knocked out after striking the steering wheel and upon awakening, the Police Officer was calling 911 and stating that I was drunk. I realized he was trying to place the blame on me so I got out and took a photo of his license plate. He took my cell phone out of my hand and smashed it on the ground. When his fellow Officer showed up, he immediately began to perform a field sobriety test, and I was arrested. I asked for a breathalyzer both on the scene and at the jail, but they told me they had no breathalyzers on site. In jail my face and left eye began sagging and it looked as though I was having a stroke. I asked for a jail nurse and all they did was take my blood pressure. After my release, I went to the emergency room where they diagnosed me with a carotid arterial dissection ie: the blunt force of the impact pinched the artery in my neck so severely that it was mimicking a stroke. I was rushed by ambulance to Temple University's  trauma center.  The Police report came back that the Officer who rear ended me was traveling at 10 mph, although the damage report  from my vehicle deemed the car was totaled, as both sides of the steel frame were bent. The Officer harassed me and my attorney in  and out of court and and further threatened me by threatening violence. I have been under the care of a neurologist with Princeton's Brain and Spine Center and officially diagnosed with both a concussion and post concussion syndrome.

1207,2022-10-21,"On October 21, 2022, I was driving home in the afternoon. At my exit, there was a merge lane that turned into the exit lane, and I was already in the exit lane. A driver in the merging lane cut off the car in front of me. I managed to avoid hitting that car, but the driver behind me wasn’t paying attention.

I was rear-ended by a car going 80 mph. My head hit the steering wheel, and then the airbag deployed. I blacked out, but I later learned that my car spun from the slow lane across five lanes into the fast lane, where it was hit head-on by another car.

Not only did I suffer three concussions within a minute, but my entire right side was also severely affected. I tore my knee, shoulder, and hip, herniated two discs—one in my neck and one in my lower back—and developed ringing in my ears with hearing loss, which now requires me to wear hearing aids. I also sustained a deviated septum that will require reconstructive surgery, TMJ, cracked teeth, and persistent pain throughout my right side. My chest was torn into my armpit, requiring reconstructive surgery, and I had to undergo an upper eyelid lift because my entire face shifted downward, making it difficult to see at night and restricting my ability to drive. I still have at least two more surgeries ahead and also suffered third-degree burns on my left side from the airbags.",Accident,"Back of Head,Front of Head,Neck",a48184e3-7f53-4775-a658-193bef78513f,1,"Loss of Consciousness,Disorientation,Incoherent Speech,Confusion,Memory Loss,Dazed or Vacant Stare",NULL
